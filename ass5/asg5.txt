In this assignment, you need to model First Order Natural Deduction 
Proof Trees as a data type.
 

First, decide on how you will represent a sequent Gamma |- phi, where 
Gamma is a set of formulas. You will need efficient ways of accessing 
phi, and of searching through Gamma. 


For each rule in ND, you will have a constructor.  
Name the constructor AndI if it is And-introduction, etc. 
 If the rule is a k-ary rule, the constructor will have arity k+1.  
 The first argument will always be the consequent of the rule (the sequent in the conclusion).   
 The remaining arguments will be Natural Deduction Proof Trees, the roots of which 
are intended to correspond to the sequents in the antecedents of the rule.

Now write a recursive function wfndp that checks if a candidate Natural Deduction 
Proof Tree is indeed well formed, i.e., the conditions that should apply regarding 
the various sequents that appear in the rule corresponding to the constructors are in fact met.
